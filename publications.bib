  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. A major research challenge today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs to facilitate applications like link prediction, knowledge base completion and question answering. Most analytics approaches, which scale horizontally (i.e., can be executed in a distributed environment) work on simple feature-vector-based input rather than more expressive knowledge structures. On the other hand, analytics methods which exploit expressive structures usually do not scale well to very large knowledge bases. This software framework paper describes the ongoing project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA) which supports expressive and scalable semantic analytics by providing functionality for distributed in-memory computing for RDF data. The library provides APIs for RDF storage, querying using SPARQL and forward chaining inference. It includes several machine learning algorithms for RDF knowledge graphs. The article describes the vision, architecture and use cases of SANSA.},

  Abstract                 = {The management and analysis of large-scale datasets -- described with the term Big Data -- involves the three classic dimensions volume, velocity and variety. While the former two are well supported by a plethora of software components, the variety dimension is still rather neglected. We present the BDE platform -- an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use and adaptable (cluster-based and standalone) platform for the execution of big data components and tools like Hadoop, Spark, Flink. The BDE platform was designed based upon the requirements gathered from the seven societal challenges put forward by the European Commission in the Horizon 2020 programme and targeted by the BigDataEurope pilots. As a result, the BDE platform allows to perform a variety of Big Data flow tasks like message passing (Kafka, Flume), storage (Hive, Cassandra) or publishing (GeoTriples). In order to facilitate the processing of heterogeneous data, a particular innovation of the platform is the semantic layer, which allows to directly process RDF data and to map and transform arbitrary data into RDF.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last years, the Semantic Web has been growing steadily. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards.
 Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may not take the full advantage of the data without having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage.
 In fact, there are already a number of tools, which offer such statistics, providing basic information about RDF datasets and vocabularies.
 However, those usually show severe deficiencies in terms of performance once the dataset size grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine.
 In this paper, we introduce a software component for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines.
 More specifically, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark.
 The preliminary results show that our distributed approach improves upon a previous centralized approach we compare against and provides approximately linear horizontal scale-up.
 The criteria are extensible beyond the 32 default criteria, is integrated into the larger SANSA framework and employed in at least four major usage scenarios beyond the SANSA community.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, vast amounts of machine-readable structured information have become available through the automation of research processes as well as the increasing popularity of knowledge graphs and semantic technologies. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets made available online following Semantic Web standards. A major and yet unsolved challenge that research faces today is to perform scalable analysis of large-scale knowledge graphs in order to facilitate applications in various domains including life sciences, publishing, and the internet of things. The main objective of this thesis is to lay foundations for efficient algorithms performing analytics, i.e. exploration, quality assessment, and querying over semantic knowledge graphs at a scale that has not been possible before. First, we propose a novel approach for statistical calculations of large RDF datasets, which scales out to clusters of machines. In particular, we describe the first distributed in-memory approach for computing 32 different statistical criteria for RDF datasets using Apache Spark. Many applications such as data integration, search, and interlinking, may take full advantage of the data when having a priori statistical information about its internal structure and coverage. However, such applications may suffer from low quality and not being able to leverage the full advantage of the data when the size of data goes beyond the capacity of the resources available. Thus, we introduce a distributed approach of quality assessment of large RDF datasets. It is the first distributed, in-memory approach for computing different quality metrics for large RDF datasets using Apache Spark. We also provide a quality assessment pattern that can be used to generate new scalable metrics that can be applied to big data. Based on the knowledge of the internal statistics of a dataset and its quality, users typically want to query and retrieve large amounts of information. As a result, it has become difficult to efficiently process these large RDF datasets. Indeed, these processes require, both efficient storage strategies and query-processing engines, to be able to scale in terms of data size. Therefore, we propose a scalable approach to evaluate SPARQL queries over distributed RDF datasets by translating SPARQL queries into Spark executable code. We conducted several empirical evaluations to assess the scalability, effectiveness, and efficiency of our proposed approaches. More importantly, various use cases i.e. Ethereum analysis, Mining Big Data Logs, and Scalable Integration of POIs, have been developed and leverages by our approach. The empirical evaluations and concrete applications provide evidence that our methodology and techniques proposed during this thesis help to effectively analyze and process large-scale RDF datasets. All the proposed approaches during this thesis are integrated into the larger SANSA framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decades the Web has evolved from a human--human communication network to a network of complex human--machine interactions.
An increasing amount of data is available as Linked Data which allows machines to “understand” the data, but RDF is not meant to be understood by humans.
With Jekyll RDF we present a method to close the gap between structured data and human accessible exploration interfaces by publishing RDF datasets as customizable static HTML sites.
It consists of an RDF resource mapping system to serve the resources under their respective IRI, a template mapping based on schema classes, and a markup language to define templates to render customized resource pages.
Using the template system, it is possible to create domain specific browsing interfaces for RDF data next to the Linked Data resources.
This enables content management and knowledge management systems to serve datasets in a highly customizable, low effort, and scalable way to be consumed by machines as well as humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Author ranking is growing in popularity since search engines are considering the author's reputation of a Web page when generating search results. A question that naturally arises is whether we should rank authors on the Web as we rank Web pages by considering their links. In addition, over what links to actually calculate author ranking? We have adopted an extended FOAF ontology, the so-called Co-AuthorOnto ontology, able to represent authors, but also their co-author links on the Web. We further extended Co-AuthorOnto with PageRank and AuthorRank metrics for ranking authors based on their co-author links. Important to note is that both PageRank and AuthorRank are implemented in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which represents a novelty and fits well with the semantic modeling of authors and their co-author relationships within FOAF. Preliminary semantic ranking results are demonstrated, showcasing also the huge potential of this ranking approach for adopting it by search engines where our future work will focus.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) integrate heterogeneous data, but one challenge is the development of efficient tools for allowing end users to extract useful insights from these sources of knowledge. In such a context, reducing the size of a Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph while preserving all information can speed up query engines by limiting data shuffle, especially in a distributed setting. This paper presents two algorithms for RDF graph summarization: Grouping Based Summarization (GBS) and Query Based Summarization (QBS). The latter is an optimized and lossless approach for the former method. We empirically study the effectiveness of the proposed lossless RDF graph summarization to retrieve complete data, by rewriting an RDF Query Language called SPARQL query with fewer triple patterns using a semantic similarity. We conduct our experimental study in instances of four datasets with different sizes. Compared with the state-of-the-art query engine Sparklify executed over the original RDF graphs as a baseline, QBS query execution time is reduced by up to 80% and the summarized RDF graph is decreased by up to 99%.}
